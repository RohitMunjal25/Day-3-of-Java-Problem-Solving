# Day-3-of-Java-Problem-Solving
In the day 3 I learn about the Oops Concepts used in java which includes class hierarchy,method overriding,abstract classes, run-time polymorphism,encapsulation , interfaces,super keyword with inheritance,method overloading,data hiding,abstraction with payment systems,static method and inheritances.

The problems I solved  are following:-

1. Create a class hierarchy with a base class Shape and derived classes Circle, 
Rectangle, and Triangle. Use method overriding to calculate the area of each shape. 
2. Design an abstract class Vehicle with abstract methods start() and stop(). Implement 
this class in Car and Bike classes with appropriate behavior. 
3. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by creating a class Employee and subclasses 
Manager and Developer. Each subclass should override a method called work(). 
4. Implement encapsulation by creating a class BankAccount with private fields 
accountNumber, balance. Provide public getters and setters with validation (e.g., 
balance cannot be negative). 
5. Create an interface Flyable with a method fly(). Implement this interface in classes 
Bird and Airplane. Demonstrate interface implementation. 
6. Create a class Person with a constructor that initializes name and age. Create a 
subclass Student that adds a field rollNumber. Use super to initialize inherited 
fields. 
7. Demonstrate method overloading by creating a class Calculator with multiple add() 
methods that accept different numbers and types of arguments (int, double, etc.). 
8. Write a program to demonstrate abstraction by creating an abstract class Payment 
with an abstract method pay(double amount). Implement it in CreditCardPayment 
and UPIPayment classes. 
9. Create two classes Parent and Child. In Parent, create a static method and try to 
override it in Child. Observe and explain the behavior. 
10. Create a class DataHider with private data members. Use getter and setter methods 
to access and update the values of these members. Demonstrate data hiding 
(encapsulation).
